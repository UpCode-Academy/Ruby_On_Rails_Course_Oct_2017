# Week 4: Testing

## Overview
While it might seem surprising to devote one whole lesson to the concept of testing, running tests is actually a huge part of Rails. Rails has a huge focus on testing as part of it's inherent framework, more so than other programming frameworks. We will be talking about the importance of testing and the inbuilt functionalities of rails. 

## Topics Covered:
1. What is TDD?
2. Rails test
3. Front end testing
4. Rails test gotchas and magic.

## Assignment:
Generate all the necessary test scripts for the routes which you have built last week. Your test scripts should include:

1. Making sure the static pages work
2. Test is scalable to include new pages
3. Test for the HTML elements to validate that they are indeed correct.

 
Do bear in mind that you should avoid overtesting by writing test cases which are too specific!
