Hello there! I'm ZP, the instructor of this course. This repository includes the materials and code examples used during the lessons, do use this for your own reference.

## The Basics

The first 3 weeks of the course, we will be focusing on theory and setting up your local machines. The last 5 weeks, we will be working together to build your own project. 

You will follow along in class as we build a rails app called HDBnb. Using what you have learnt from HDBnb, you will apply that back to your own app.

## Homework

There will be homework and assignments each week, the homework is to help you understand and solidify your learnings from the class.

You are encouraged to apply all that you have learnt into your own project and assignment.

## Communication

We will be using Slack as our primary form of communication. If you are still not in our Slack channel, please contact me to add you in.
