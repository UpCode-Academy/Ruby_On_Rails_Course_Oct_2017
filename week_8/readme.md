# Week 8: Prepare for Demo Day

## Overview

Congrats guys! It's our last lesson together!

We will tie up everything which we have learnt so far. We will be merging MVC together to create a web form for our code example today.

I will also demostrate how easy it is to use a rails gem from online to build what we need. We will be adding the devise gem to our project to create users and authentication.

Good job guys! You have all the tools that a web developer has. Now, you can finish your web app and prepare for the demo day.

It was a pleasure to instruct you guys. All the best for demo!
