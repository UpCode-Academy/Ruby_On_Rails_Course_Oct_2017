# Week 6: Controllers

## Overview
This is the second part of the MVC series. Today we are looking at controllers and writing logic into our Rails App. We will also be looking at other companies' platforms and try to dissect their controllers. We will be covering a bit on web security too and understand why there are certain web structures in place. 

Week 6 guys! We are almost there!

## Topics Covered
1. Routes and Controllers
2. Building controllers with scaffolding.
3. Generating skeleton controllers
4. Writing our own controllers
5. Controllers and views
6. Preventing basic web hacing techniques - Injections

## Assignment:
Let's relook at how we have generated our static pages in the app. Delete the static pages that we have, then generate them properly with the right controllers. After which, move your view files properly to the right folders. 

Run your tests! They should all work regardless! If there are errors, try and fix them.

If you are unsure on the controllers which your app might need, feel free to reach out to me on Slack. I will be able to provide some input.
