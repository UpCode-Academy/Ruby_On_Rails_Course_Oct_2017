# Week 7: Models

## Overview
This the last part of our MVC series! For today's lesson, we will be looking at models. Models is the glue which links up our database to the project. We will be looking at how Rails is storing and retriving data. Then, we will manipulate some static data and incorporate them into our application.

## Topics Covered
1. Rails console
2. Databases
3. Generate model with rails generate command
4. How to Build Validations
5. Techniques for Buiding a Good Model

## Assignment
Similar to last week's assignment, now generate the models which you need. You should generate the models along with writing validations and other necessary logic for your app. 

If you are unsure on the jmodels which your app might need, feel free to reach out to me on Slack. I will be able to provide some input.
