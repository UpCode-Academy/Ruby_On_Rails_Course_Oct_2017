# Week 5: Ruby and Views

## Overview
Week 5 guys! We are over half way through. 

This lesson is in two parts, first we will talk about Ruby then subsequently, views. It's interesting that we are only looking at ruby itself after spending half the course only on Rails. But its a good time now to understand what we have been doing from a code level. 

We will be beginning our three part series now into deepdiving MVC. Views is the first thing we will cover from MVC. Views is very straight forward - all we are doing is generating HTML, CSS and JS. We will explain the concepts of rails layouts and use Twitter's Bootstrap to help us get started.

## Topics Covered:
1. Intro to Coding
2. Writing code with Ruby
2. Advanced HTML and CSS
3. Understanding Rails Layout
2. Gemfile
3. Using Twitter Bootstrap

## Assignment:
It's time to bring the Bootstrap magic into our webapp! Install Twitter Bootstrap to your app and start doing styling. In your assignment, include the following 2 HTML elements:

1. Buttons
2. Tables
