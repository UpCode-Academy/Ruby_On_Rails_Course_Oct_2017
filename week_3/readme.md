# Week 3: Rails Scaffolding

## Overview

Rails scaffolding is a simple way to get started, but it's difficult to customise or make changes to the core default logic. We will be taking a deep dive to see the features which rails scaffolding has built for us, and we will learn to implement these features ourselves.

## Topics Covered:
1. Scaffolding: What are the files generated?
2. Rails helpers
3. How does the rails routes work?
4. Understanding error messages.
5. Creating a new rails routes.

## Assignment:
It's time to apply rails routes generation and scaffolding to our projects. Generate a few static pages which your app will need.

If you are unsure of what your pages your app might require, consider generating the pages below:

1. Home
